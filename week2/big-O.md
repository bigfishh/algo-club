## SWBATs
- [ ] Understand what an interviewer during a whiteboarding interview 
- [ ] Have a solid whiteboarding approach 
- [ ] Define 'algorithm' 
- [ ] Stand their ground in front of Big O terminology 
- [ ] Identify code that runs in constant, linear, logarithmic, and quadratic time 

## Discussion Question
1. What is an interviewer looking for? 
2. What is good code? 
3. What are the steps to approach a whiteboarding question? 

Write a function called
`hasTargetSum` that receives two arguments:
  * an array of integers
  * a target integer

The function should return all pairs of numbers found in the array that add up to the target number.

```js

hasTargetSum([-1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 11, 7], 10)
// should return
// [[-1, 11], [3, 7]]

// it is fine if you return repeats
// ex:
// [[-1, 11], [3, 7], [11, -1], [7, 3]]


// Example 2:
hasTargetSum([22, 19, 4, 6, 30, -6], 25)
// returns
// [[19, 6]]
// or [[19, 6], [6, 19]]
```
