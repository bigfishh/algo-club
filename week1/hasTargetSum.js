// Write a function called
// `hasTargetSum` that receives two arguments:
//   * an array of integers
//   * a target integer

// The function should return all pairs of numbers found in the array that add up to the target number.
// hasTargetSum([-1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 11, 7], 10) ==>  [[-1, 11], [3, 7]]


function hasTargetSum(arr, target) {
    // write code here
}

console.log(hasTargetSum([-1, 3, 8, 12, 4, 11, 7], 10))

// Whiteboarding Approach! 
// 1. Repeat the questions back, in your own words
// 2. Give an example of what you think they're asking for, ask for examples, and look out for edge cases 
// 3. Pseudocode first! Get really comfortable processing your thoughts out loud 
// 4. Code 
// 5. Test your code! Run the examples from step 2 and see if your code is actually working the way you think it is 
// 6. Analyze and optimize
